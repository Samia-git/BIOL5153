## Research Projects
1. Undergrad senior year project study: Application of serological techniques for the detection of etiological
agents from clinical specimen (January, 2014- March, 2014)
Supervisor: Dr. Donald James Gomes
Find out the etiological agents from clinical specimen by applying various serological techniques e.g. Agglutination
assay, Haemagglutination assay, Flocculation assay, ELISA etc.
2. Master of Science (thesis): Application of plant growth promoting bacteria for sustainable coastal
agriculture under changing climate conditions (June, 2014- August, 2015)
Supervisor: Dr. Muhammad Manjurul Karim
Find out salt-tolerant plant growth promoting bacteria for its potential application as bio-fertilizer in salinity prone
coastal agricultural fields. Our project was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the
People’s Republic of Bangladesh and our paper is in press in the “Canadian Journal of Microbiology"
3. Doctoral Dissertation: Molecular Characerization of Compartment Boundary during Drosophila Development (January, 2020- Present)
Supervisor: Dr. Adam Pare
Performed Expansion Microscopy (EM) of the compartment boundary in Drosophila embryo & Genomic DNA, Plasmid DNA Extraction for cloning of LRR proteins, and Confocal Microscopy
